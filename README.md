# actuator-service

This repository tests the [Building a RESTful Web Service with Spring Boot Actuator](https://spring.io/guides/gs/actuator-service/) tutorial presented by the Spring Boot project. Together with the tutorial, this project also employs a basic documentation generated by the Springfox Swagger.

In general, the tutorial shows how to build a REST endpoint, called "hello-world" whith Spring Boot Actuator, that returns a JSON containing an auto-generated ID and a string informing "Hello, Stranger!" or "Hello, " + parameter name informed + "!". 

To run the project, just execute any of the following commnad:


> gradlew.bat clean build && java -jar build/libs/actuator-service-0.0.1.jar (Windows)<br>
> ./gradlew clean build && java -jar build/libs/actuator-service-0.0.1.jar (Linux)

The hello-world endpoint can be accessed through the following URL:

> http://localhost:8080/hello-world

Note that it has an optional parameter called name that can be supplied with the URL:

> http://localhost:8080/hello-world?name=Carlos

The results of both above requests will be respectively:
```javascript
{"id":1,"content":"Hello, Stranger!"}
{"id":2,"content":"Hello, Carlos!"}
```
The documentation produced by Springfox Swagger can be acessed either as a JSON through the link:

> http://localhost:8080/v2/api-docs

Or, as a UI generated by Swagger UI:

> http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html

To check whether the server is properly up, one can check it (besides the logs on the terminal) via:

> http://localhost:8080/actuator/health
